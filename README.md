# Employee Churn Analysis Project

## Overview:
Welcome to our Employee Churn Analysis Project! Our mission is to empower your company with data-driven insights to improve employee retention. Leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning, we'll identify key factors contributing to churn and provide actionable recommendations to reduce turnover rates.

## Problem Statement:
High turnover rates are impacting your company's bottom line and morale. Our goal is to proactively predict employee churn and uncover the underlying causes to implement effective retention strategies.

### Approach:
- **Select Pilot Program with New Employees:** We'll kickstart our analysis by focusing on a pilot program with new employees to develop and refine our predictive model.
- **Build an AutoML Model:** Harnessing the power of AutoML, we'll train a robust model on historical data to predict employee churn with accuracy.

### Deliverable:
Get ready to unlock insights with our comprehensive report and dynamic dashboard, highlighting churn patterns and personalized retention strategies.

## Analysis Questions:
1. **What is Causing Employees to Leave?**
2. **Who is Predicted to Leave? (highest probability to leave)**
3. **Are Employees Satisfied?**
4. **What Departments Have the Most Churn?**

## Project Questions:
1. **What Does Success Look Like?**
   - A highly accurate predictive model empowering proactive decision-making and reducing turnover rates.
2. **What Does Failure Look Like?**
   - Inaccurate predictions leading to missed opportunities for retention and continued high churn rates.
3. **What Trends are Important?**
   - Identifying critical trends and patterns to understand the root causes of churn and tailor retention strategies accordingly.
4. **What Actions Affect the Trend?**
   - Actionable recommendations derived from insightful analysis to address underlying factors and drive positive change.

## Machine Learning Workflow:
1. **Train:** Train the machine learning model on 70% of the existing employee dataset (approximately 15,000 employees).
2. **Test:** Test and fine-tune the model for accuracy using the remaining 30% of the dataset.
3. **Predict:** Utilize the optimized machine learning model to predict which employees in our pilot program are likely to churn.

## Recommendations:
- **Employee Recognition Program:** Foster a culture of appreciation and recognition to boost morale and retention.
- **Professional Development Initiatives:** Invest in employees' growth and skill development to enhance job satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Retention Bonuses/Incentives:** Reward long-term commitment and performance to incentivize employee retention.

## Usage:
1. **Building the Database:** Set up the database schema on BigQuery to store employee data securely.
2. **Connecting to Database with Python:** Establish seamless connectivity between Python (Colab) and BigQuery for streamlined data analysis.
3. **Building the Churn Model:** Leverage PyCaret to build and train a sophisticated churn prediction model.
4. **Exporting Data to BigQuery:** Store processed data and model results in BigQuery for easy access and future analysis.
5. **Building the Dashboard:** Craft an intuitive and visually stunning dashboard using Looker Studio to visualize churn insights with impact.

## Additional Notes:
- Elevate your retention strategy with data-driven insights.
- Stay agile by regularly updating and refining the predictive model.
- Collaborate effectively by documenting all pipeline modifications for future reference.
